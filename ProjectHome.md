# Introduction #

The zinc-tutorial project is an effort to create and maintain a set of demonstration examples on how to use the [Zinc plugin](http://cmiss.org/cmgui/zinc) for interactive visualisation and manipulation of (finite element) fields in your web browser. The traditional [Cmgui](http://cmiss.org/cmgui) software from the [Auckland Bioengineering Institute](http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz) is gradually being updated to be released as libzinc, whereby users will be working directly with the API exposed by the library in order to achieve their goals. As this migration happens these tutorials may be expanded to include other language bindings in addition to the JavaScript API used by the browser plugin.


# Details #

The current tutorials are available for live [demonstration](http://zinc-tutorial.googlecode.com/hg/index.html), but in future we may make static releases of the tutorials available to match the release cycle of libzinc and the zinc plugin.
